# Email Archiving

I have trouble organizing my email in a very clean way. What I do right now is
just archiving some mails that I think I could probably use them another time
again. I very rarely come to the point where I have to reuse an email again.
What's much more likely is that I need information or attachments from an
email. So I want to have a place where I store this information reliably and
also easy to recall.

One way of archiving the important information is by putting it into my notes
system. After inserting the important information, I should absolutely delete
the email. This process is not straight forward. i.e. I is not necessarily
clear what the important information is or where is should end up.


## Example for extracting Information from Emails

Some emails just have some very simple information in them, as e.g. a date for
an event. This can be processes very quickly, by just adding this information
into a calendar.

Other emails might have some very clear information, as e.g. the weekly
newsletter from SOUP, where I can just extract the information and put it into
my notes.

More complex information are i.e. an email with some attachment. The limitation
here is currently my note taking system. I have no good way to store and
reference files, since I don't really want them in my version control. Other
attachments might go to a very specific place in my workspace. So there is no
simple rule to follow.


## Workflow for extracting Information from Emails

When reading an email I should go through the following steps:

 1. Read the Subject
    - If it is not at all interesting, discard the mail
    - If it might be interesting, cross read the mail
 2. Read the email in detail
    - Assign tags from note system to it
    - Summarize content in own words
    - If it contains information worth keeping, insert into notes
    - If it needs reply, reply to the email
 3. Work on longer email
    - If an email takes more than a few minutes to work on, move it to another
      folder and decide when to work on it.
